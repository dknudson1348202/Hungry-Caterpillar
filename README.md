# Hungry-Caterpillar
Game created in processing that is similar to a snake game. 
The game begins with a single circle (caterpillar head) moving around the screen. Use the arrow keys to move the cirlce up, down, left and right to eat the pieces of candy. When the caterpillar eats a piece of candy, his body grows longer by once circle. If you hit the edges, you don't die. Instead, if you hit an edge, it will move the caterpillar to the opposite edge. If the caterpillar runs into itself, it's Game Over.
